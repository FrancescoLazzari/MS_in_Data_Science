This repository collects the main homeworks and projects done during the various courses of my master's degree.

> **Note:**
> Each homework was done with tight deadlines ($< 2$ weeks each), overlapping with other assignments and lectures ($\sim27$ hours per week per semester). Therefore please do not consider the homework as a reliable indicator of the author's abilities.
