# DATA:
The data can be downloaded from the following GitHub repository:
   -  https://github.com/tidyverse/nycflights13/tree/main

NOTE: In the repository the 5 tables are not all present in the .csv format (table flights is only in .Rdata)
      So, we initially dowloaded all the .Rdata file and opened them in RStudio and converted them into .csv file using the following code:
        -  write.csv(imported_table, "new_data_name.csv", row.names = FALSE)
      In order to speed up this process we have also submitted all the original data already converted into .csv that can be found into the 'Data' folder

# MATERIALS:
  -  'HW1_Database_creation.sql'  -> SQL code for the creation of the initial Database for HW1 
  -  'HW2_Database_creation.sql'  -> SQL code for the creation of the refined schema for HW2
  -  'Preprocessing.ipynb'        -> Jupyter notebook with the python code used for the preprocessing of the original Data uploaded on GitHub
  -  'HW1_query.sql'              -> SQL code containing the query for the HW1 assignment 
  -  'HW2_query.sql'              -> SQL code containing the optimized query for the HW1 assignment 


# ADDITIONAL MATERIALS:
  -  'EER - Diagrams.png'         -> .png file with the Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagrams of the two schemas created for the assignments
  -  'Data'                       -> Folder with the original data that can be found on GitHub already converted into .csv file
  -  'Insert Data'                -> Folder with the two SQL file used for inserting the records into the two databases
      -  'HW1_global_insert.sql'  -> SQL code for the insert statements for the schema for HW1
      -  'HW1_global_insert.sql'  -> SQL code for the insert statements for the schema for HW2
